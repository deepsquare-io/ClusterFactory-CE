# ClusterFactory DeepSquare Edition

## Overview

ClusterFactory CE is a Kubernetes-based infrastructure orchestrator. ClusterFactory brings together best-in-class solutions from the HPC, Cloud, and DevOps industries to manage a cluster in a declarative way in combination with the GitOps practice.

## Key features

- Production-ready vanilla upstream [Kubernetes](https://docs.clusterfactory.io/docs/main-concepts/k0s)
- Easy deploy, backup, restore, and update with [cfctl](https://docs.clusterfactory.io/docs/reference/cfctl)
- Scalable from single node to large, high-available clusters
- GitOps-enabled with [ArgoCD](https://docs.clusterfactory.io/docs/main-concepts/gitops/argocd) and [Sealed Secrets](https://docs.clusterfactory.io/docs/main-concepts/gitops/sealed-secrets)
- VM workloads with KubeVirt
- Bare-metal workloads with [Slurm](https://docs.clusterfactory.io/docs/main-concepts/apps/slurm)
- Bare-metal provisioning with [xCAT](https://docs.clusterfactory.io/docs/main-concepts/apps/xcat)
- Supports CNI plugins with [Multus CNI](https://docs.clusterfactory.io/docs/main-concepts/core-network/multus-cni)
- TLS/SSL certificates management with [cert-manager](https://docs.clusterfactory.io/docs/main-concepts/gitops/cert-manager)
- Mirror of DeepSquare's software library (end user software) by using [CVMFS Stratum 1](https://docs.clusterfactory.io/docs/main-concepts/apps/cvmfs)
- A web-based HPC user portal Open Ondemand
- Monitoring stack (Grafana, Prometheus with ready-to-use exporters)

## Motivation

For [DeepSquare](https://deepsquare.io), we wish to develop applications for the DeepSquare Grid. Because of that, our infrastructure uses a lot of HPC technologies,
which makes it difficult to scale. We believe that **flexibity**, **repeatability**, **availability** and **ease of use** should be prioritized
for managing and scaling HPC clusters.

This is why we are developing ClusterFactory CE:

- **Performance-oriented**: Integrates a key-in-hand HPC stack including Slurm, MPI, DFS, etc.
- **Highly configurable**: With Helm, all configuration is done in a single `values.yaml` file.
- **Repeatable**: With Argo CD following GitOps practices, all states are specified declaratively and saved in a Git repository.
- **Highly available**: With Kubernetes, container scheduling is automatically ensured and easy to set up.
- **Simple**: A single descriptive YAML per application, with Argo CD to automatically updates the application.
- **Long-term maintainability**: Easy to deploy, update, backup and restore with K0s.
